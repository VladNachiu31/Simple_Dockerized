# Simple_Dockerized

Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. This container can then be deployed on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between environments.

The first app mentioned in the statement is written in JavaScript and uses the Node.js framework. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. The app has likely been containerized using Docker, meaning that all of its dependencies, including the Node.js runtime and any necessary libraries, have been packaged into a Docker container.

The second app mentioned is written in Python, a popular general-purpose programming language. Like the Node.js app, this app has also likely been containerized using Docker, meaning that it has been packaged with all of its dependencies into a Docker container.

In summary, the statement "Inside this repository are 2 dockerized app. One in JS using Node.JS and another one in Python" means that the repository contains two separate applications, one written in JavaScript using the Node.js framework, and another written in Python. Both applications have been containerized using Docker, allowing them to be easily deployed on any system that supports Docker.
